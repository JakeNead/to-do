# To-Do

This was a step up in complexity and difficulty compared to my previous projects. I was able to put into practice many concepts I have been learning over the last few weeks. 

Goals:

- Follow the SOLID principles with emphasis on single-responsibility objects.
- Use the date-fns library to streamline date/time tasks.
- Utilize local storage.
- Use Webpack to manage increasing project complexity.
